# Governance Ariel OS


The Ariel OS project is dedicated to creating a general-purpose operating system (OS) for low-power, microcontroller-based IoT devices, written from scratch in Rust, providing easy portability of application code to diverse microcontroller-based hardware. This governance document explains how the project is run.


## Values

Ariel OS and its leadership embrace the following values:

* Openness: Communication and decision-making happens in the open and is discoverable for future reference. As much as possible, all discussions and work take place in public forums and open repositories.

* Fairness: All stakeholders have the opportunity to provide feedback and submit contributions. These contributions will be considered on their merits.

* Inclusivity: We innovate through different perspectives and skill sets, which can only be accomplished in a welcoming and respectful environment.


## Digital commons

Ariel OS is a digital public good, or digital common, supported by public funding. The project's outcome is [open source](https://github.com/ariel-os/ariel-os/blob/main/LICENSE) and freely available for everyone.


## Decision making

Decisions within Ariel OS are made with consensus, as much as possible, among team members, based on technical arguments. The Founder-leaders have override power, for strategic steering and/or to break ties.


## Roles

### Founder-leaders

Kaspar Schleiser and Emmanuel Baccelli.

The founder-leaders are the final decision-makers. Emmanuel Baccelli is responsible for selecting team members and funding. Kaspar Schleiser is technical lead.


### Team members

Specific tasks have been divided among the team members by the founder-leaders. Team members have write access to the [project GitHub repository](https://github.com/ariel-os/ariel-os) and can merge pull requests. Team members collectively maintain and manage the project's resources and contributors.

This privilege is granted with some expectation of responsibility: team members are people who care about the Ariel OS project and want to help it grow and improve. A team member is not just someone who can make changes, but someone who has demonstrated their ability to collaborate with the team, get the most knowledgeable people to review code and docs, contribute high-quality code, and follow through to fix issues (in code or tests). A team member is a contributor to the project's success and a citizen helping the project succeed.


### Contributors

Anyone can contribute to the Ariel OS project, for example via comments on issues or pull requests, writing code or documentation etc. 


## Getting involved

Decisions about the Ariel OS project are made in the matrix chat room and during the weekly meetings. If you have questions about the direction the Ariel OS project is taking, or want to get involved in the decision making process, you can get in contact via these channels.


### Matrix chat room

The [Ariel OS Matrix chat room](https://matrix.to/#/#ariel-os:matrix.org) is the main communication channel for all users, contributors and team members of Ariel OS. It is open to anyone interested in the project, so feel free to join! 


### Weekly meeting

Team members meet weekly online to discuss the current progress of the project. The meeting is open to interested contributors. The link to the meeting is available in the [Matrix chat](https://matrix.to/#/#ariel-os:matrix.org).


### GitHub

All code and documentation of Ariel OS is available at the [Ariel OS GitHub](https://github.com/ariel-os/ariel-os).
