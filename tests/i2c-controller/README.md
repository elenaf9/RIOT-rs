# i2c-controller

## About

This application is testing raw I2C bus usage in RIOT-rs.
Please use `riot_rs::sensors` instead for a high-level sensor abstraction that is architecture-agnostic.

## How to run

In this folder, run

    laze build -b nrf52840dk run

This example requires a LIS3DH sensor (3-axis accelerometer) attached to the pins configured in the test.
